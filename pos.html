<div class="container">
    <!-- <div class="static">Static</div>
    <div>Description: This is the default positioning behavior of HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.</div>
    <div class="relative">Relative</div>
    <div>Description: Relative positioning moves an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. It allows you to adjust the position using properties like top, bottom, left, and right, without affecting the layout of surrounding elements.</div>
    <div class="absolute">Absolute</div>
    
    <div>Description: Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if there's no positioned ancestor). It's often used for creating overlays or positioning elements precisely within a container.

    <div class="fixed">Fixed</div>
    <div>Description: Fixed positioning removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to the viewport (the browser window). The element remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.</div>
    <div class="sticky">Sticky</div>
    <div>Description: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it reaches a specified threshold (usually defined by top, bottom, left, or right), at which point it becomes fixed.</div>
